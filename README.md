Credit Card Fraud Prediction - README
======================================================

1. Project Overview:
--------------------
This project aims to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used for training and testing contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset is highly unbalanced, with only 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.

2. Dataset:
-----------
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be found at:
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

Columns:
- Time: Number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset
- V1-V28: Features obtained through PCA transformation (to protect sensitive information)
- Amount: Transaction amount
- Class: Target variable where 1 indicates fraud and 0 indicates non-fraud

3. Methods:
-----------
The following methods and techniques were employed in this project:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and its characteristics
- Preprocessing techniques such as scaling and handling imbalanced data
- Machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - 
- Evaluation metrics: Precision, Recall, Accuracy-metrics

4. Files:
---------
- `credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the entire code pipeline from data exploration to model evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python libraries required to run the code.

5. Usage:
---------
To run the notebook:
- Clone the repository.
- Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Open `credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.

6. Results:
-----------
The best-performing model achieved an F1-score of [insert score] on the test set, with [insert additional metrics].

7. Conclusion:
--------------
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Further improvements could involve exploring advanced anomaly detection algorithms or deploying the model in a real-time transaction monitoring system.
